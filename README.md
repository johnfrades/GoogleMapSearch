GoogleMapSearch

<br>
Built on HTML, Bootstrap, NodeJS

<br>

2 Functionalities:

1. Search for a place and it shows where is the place and the reviews and ratings.

2. Shows the distance between 2 places. You can select the mode of transportation either by Walking or Driving. So the distance time differs.



How to start:

-- Install NodeJS
-- on CMD/Git-Bash, type "npm install" to install dependencies
-- then start the server by issuing the command "node index.js"

Server starts at PORT 3000
