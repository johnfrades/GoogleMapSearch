GoogleMapSearch

<br>
Built on HTML, Bootstrap, NodeJS

<br>

2 Functionalities:

1. Search for a place and it shows where is the place and the reviews and ratings.

2. Shows the distance between 2 places. You can select the mode of transportation either by Walking or Driving. So the distance time differs.


Feel free to check it out!


Cheers!
